    name: 'Kimberly Nguyen',
    position: 'Senior Software Engineer',
    date: 'January 17, 2023',
    relationship: 'Kimberly worked with Phill on the same team at Sessions',
    body: "Phill is a talented engineer who is always excited for a new challenge, takes the initiative to learn and improve, and effortlessly brightens a room with his sense of humor. I was lucky to start at Sessions after him, and always felt comfortable going to him with questions or for help. I learned so much as an engineer from pairing with him and seeing his fast and creative problem solving at work, whether he was tackling MobX state management, squashing complex bugs, or building out pixel-perfect and performant UI. He's a Minnesotan force of nature that any team would be lucky to have, and also an incredibly talented musician! If you're lucky, he'll bless your ears with his guitalele shredding.",

    name: 'Joshua Kaulius',
    position: 'Sr. Program Manager, Cloud Marketing Studio at Microsoft',
    date: 'January 10, 2023',
    relationship: 'Joshua managed Phill directly at Microsoft',
    body: 'You know how there are some people who are super dedicated and eager to learn and dig into their roles? And you know how there are some people who are just an absolute joy to work with on a personal level and make coming to the office (virtual or otherwise) a pleasure day in and day out? Well, with Phill you have the true all-in-one package. Phill really embodied the Microsoft spirit of "Growth Mindset" - always willing to both build on and contribute to the success of other. He was curious, committed, and never not-interesting. Whether you want to go down a rabbit hole on React, the finer points of home made Thai food, or obscure Indian-Jazz fusion - Phill is your man. I truly miss having the opportunity to work with Phill on a daily basis. He was a dynamo of positive contributions to both our code and our culture, and I hope to have the opportunity to have him on a team of mine in the future. *In my best Larry David-as-George Steinbrenner voice*: HIRE THIS MAN!',

    body: 'Phill is a quirky character that adds a lot of flavor to the team. I was always astonished by his approach to problem-solving and the end result was always a performant and aesthetically pleasing feature. He emits a very positive and upbeat attitude that is quite contagious. Every paired programming session with him was a treat and it was great seeing his creative mind at work. He has helped me through more issues and bugs than I can count. Wherever he ends up next, you are all lucky to have him.',

He contributed early during onboarding and is incredibly receptive to feedback. Phill's a joy to work with. His determination and creativity is inspiring, extending far beyond the realm of engineering.",
