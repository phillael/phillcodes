        Behold! I am the one known as Phill Aelony. Specializing in React,
        TypeScript, and Next.js. With a keen eye for detail and a love for
        clean, efficient code, and accessibility. I strive to create the

        possible in the universe.

        When I'm not coding, you will find me playing crazy jazz chords on the
        guitar, cooking better than anyone else you know, or exploring the great
        outdoors.
